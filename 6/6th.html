            <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.<br>
            Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at<br>
            least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity<br>
            and coherence of ideas among sentences<br> is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or<br>
            a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine<br>
            whether a section in a paper is<br> a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic<br>
            styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long</p>
            <p>Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.<br>
            In this handout, we will refer to this as the<br>
            “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
